# Discussion Forum Web Application
This project is a comprehensive implementation of a discussion forum web application, developed using ASP.NET Core 6.0 and the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. It is inspired by platforms like Stack Overflow, allowing users to ask and answer code-related questions.

#Project Description
This web application serves as a discussion forum where users can ask questions and respond to others' queries, specifically focused on coding and technical topics. The key highlights of the project are:

Users can browse and view questions and answers without logging in.
Registered users can post questions, reply to questions, and edit or delete their own posts.
Questions are categorized into one of ten distinct categories, making it easier to navigate and find relevant topics.
The project aims to create a simple, user-friendly platform for technical discussions while maintaining a systematic approach to categorizing and displaying content.
